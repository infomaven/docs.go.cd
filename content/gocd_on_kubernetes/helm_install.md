## Getting Started with GoCD on Kubernetes

# Step 2: Install the GoCD Helm chart

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Kubernetes packages are called charts. Charts are curated applications for Kubernetes.  

Install the official GoCD Helm chart with this command:

```bash
helm install stable/gocd --name gocd --namespace gocd
```

## Access the GoCD server

After you've installed the GoCD helm chart, you should be able to access the GoCD server from the Ingress IP.

The Ingress IP address can be obtained as specified below:

- Minikube

    ```bash
    minikube ip
    ```

- For other Kubernetes offerings like GKE and EKS:

    ```bash
    ip=$(kubectl get ingress --namespace gocd gocd-server -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
    echo "http://$ip"
    ```

*Note: It might take a few minutes for the GoCD server to come up for the first time. You can check if the GoCD server is available with this command:*

```bash
kubectl get deployments --namespace gocd
```

The GoCD server starts with a sample "Hello World" pipeline that looks like:
